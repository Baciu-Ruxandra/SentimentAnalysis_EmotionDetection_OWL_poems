Hope, a color bright and bold,

In its hues, stories told,

Painting life in optimism’s mold,

In its spectrum, our dreams unfold.

 

With every stroke, a brighter scene,

In hope’s color, life’s sheen,

A canvas of joy, serene,

Optimism’s glean, in between.

 

Hope’s color, in our heart’s art,

In each shade, a new start,

In its palette, life’s chart,

Optimism’s part, in every heart.
