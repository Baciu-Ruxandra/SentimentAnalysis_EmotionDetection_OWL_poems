In the day’s deep sea, I find myself drowning,

Under waves of tasks, endlessly crowning.


Each tick of the clock, a wave over head,

In this ocean of time, my fears spread.

 

Swamped by the minutes, the hours, the rush,

In this tide, my peace, hush.

Gasping for a moment’s relief,

In time’s sea, my overwhelming grief.

 

Drowning in the day, in tasks untold,

In its depths, my calm is sold.

In the clock’s relentless flow,

In its current, my struggles grow.
