Tomorrow sings a hopeful tune,

A melody under the moon,

Promise of a brighter soon,

Optimism’s boon, a fortune.

 

With every sunrise, a new song,

Where hope and dreams belong,

In tomorrow’s chorus, we’re strong,

Optimism’s throng, where we throng.

 

Each day, a new beginning’s wing,

In tomorrow’s hymn, we sing,

Hope’s bell, forever ring,

Optimism’s spring, in everything.
