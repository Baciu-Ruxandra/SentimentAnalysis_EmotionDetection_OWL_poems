Within my mind’s twisting maze,

Thoughts run wild, a haunting haze,


Shadows dance in cryptic ways,

Sanity blurs in the gaze.

 

Corridors of whispering doubt,

Echoing fears, a silent shout,

In this labyrinth, I’m without,

A way in or a way out.

 

Walls of confusion, high and steep,

In my psyche, secrets keep,

Through the maze, madness seeps,

In my mind’s labyrinth, deep.
