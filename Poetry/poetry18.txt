In the mirror, a fractured sight,

Broken shards of light and night,

Madness twists the wrong and right,

Blurring lines, a perilous plight.

 

Reflections dance in twisted forms,

In my mind, a battleground storms,

In these reflections, reality warms,

To madness’ ever-changing norms.

 

Gazing into the broken glass,

Each fragment a different pass,

Madness’ hand, a heavy mass,

In reflections, myself I outclass.
