Golden fingers stretch and reach,

Morning’s first, a gentle breach,


Nature stirs, begins to wake,

In sunlight’s warm, embracing ache.

 

Fields of green gleam with dew,

Birds in flight, skies so blue,

Whispers of light touch the land,

Nature heeds sun’s soft command.

 

Each new dawn, a promise kept,

By the sun as Earth has slept,

With every rise, life anew,

Bathed in morning’s golden hue.
