Every sunrise whispers a chance,

A new story, a fresh glance,


In its light, dreams dance,

Hope’s embrace in morning’s expanse.

 

With each dawn, a clean slate,

Hope’s song, early and late,

In its glow, we navigate,

Optimism’s gate, we celebrate.

 

Sunrise, a hopeful creed,

In its rays, our spirits freed,

Every dawn, optimism’s seed,

In each morning, hope we heed.
