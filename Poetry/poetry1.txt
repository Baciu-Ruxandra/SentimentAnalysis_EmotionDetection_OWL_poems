Dreams once bright, now dull and gray,

Fading slowly, day by day.

Hopes that soared, now grounded, still,

In their silence, a bitter pill.

 

Reaching high, yet grasping air,

In this void, deep despair.

Unfulfilled, they taunt and jeer,

In their echo, frustrationâ€™s leer.

 

Yet, in the dark, a spark ignites,

New dreams, new hopes, new flights.

From the ashes of the old,

New stories, bravely told.
