In the night’s deepest hour,

Hope shines with gentle power,

A beacon in the dark tower,

Optimism, a blooming flower.

 

Even in shadows, hope’s light gleams,

In darkness, it’s brighter than it seems,

Guiding through the night’s streams,

In its glow, our future dreams.

 

Darkness fades, hope’s light stays,

Through night’s maze, it paves ways,

In its beam, optimism plays,

Light in dark, hope always sways.
