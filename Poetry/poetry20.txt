Threads of life, tangled in a mess,

Unraveling them, a test of stress.

Pulling, tugging, yet tighter they bind,

In these knots, frustration I find.

 

Each effort made, seems in vain,

In this tangle, only strain.

Patience thin, fingers sore,

In this mess, a never-ending chore.

 

Breath deep, slow and steady,

Hands calm, now ready.

Gently untangle, one by one,

In patience, frustration undone.
