In the void, echoes call,

Whispering of the fall.

Empty spaces, vast, unclear,

Hold the echoes of our fear.

 

What hides in nothingness so vast?

In the void, shadows are cast.

Fear of emptiness, profound,

In the silence, fears resound.

 

Yet, in this void, potential hides,

In emptiness, opportunity resides.

Embrace the void, let fear subside,

In the unknown, let hope reside.
