## Project Overview  
This project applies **ontology-based reasoning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze emotions in text. Using **Owlready2**, **spaCy**, and **fuzzy string matching**, it extracts and infers emotions based on symbolic representations.

### Features  
- **Ontology-Driven Emotion Recognition** – Extracts emotions using **EmotionOntology.owl**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Uses **spaCy** for text preprocessing  
- **Symbol & Cause Matching** – Detects **emotion-related** symbols and causes  
- **Ontology-Based Emotion Inference** – Enriches extracted emotions with **intensity, polarity, and relationships**  
- **Visualization & Sentiment Analysis** – Generates **emotion contribution charts** and calculates an **overall sentiment score**
